Welcome to devops
-----------------
Developed by Christopher Williams

A tool representing a conglomeration of ideas I have produced in various tools
for myself and various employers over the years.

e.g. SCRAM (as used at CERN), mpp

The main purpose is to:
1) provide an easy to use command line interface to devops processes and workflows for the developer
2) explicit dependency management 
3) easy deployment and reproducability of complex development environments

Installation
------------
You need :
- Perl5 (v.5.10 minimum)

Assuming that to be reading this you have checked out a copy of devops from 
the devops repository. You can then continue with 

1) cd Installation (this directory)
2) ./install_devops (will default install to /usr/local/bin. Use -h option for help)

Thats it - enjoy.
