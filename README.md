# Devops

A command line tool to aid the developer. 
It's a conglomoration of ideas from other tools I have built over the years and other projects.

Most ideas come from the original SCRAM tool I wrote for large distributed development teams at CERN
(see http://www.drdobbs.com/programmers-toolchest/184404570#), with other bits and pieces from other
projects I've worked on since.

At the moment there is very basic functionality (see Current Features), but it is hoped this will be extended
to fully support the entire software process chain, from setting your environment , integration and release
management, pacakging and publication.

## Current Features
### Well Defined Development Environments
- checkout, modify, and build any link in your dependency chain.

## Getting Started
Coming soon
